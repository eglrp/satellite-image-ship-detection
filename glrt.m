function [what] = glrt(image, window_shape, threshold)
    % Computes the GLRT (Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test) from paper
    % "Characterization of a Bayesian Ship Detection Method in Optical 
    % Satellite Images". Assume the image is 75x75 pixels.
    
    % Computes the logarithms of the likelihood of the image given by
    % L(H1) - L(H0)*a*NI*m1^2 + N0*m0^2 - NAma^2
